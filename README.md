This is a game developed for mobile, browser and desktops.

Check the [releases](https://github.com/luanorlandi/Swift-Space-Battle/releases) tab and the [html host](https://luanorlandi.github.io/Swift-Space-Battle/) here to play it.

## More than just a game

Swift Space Battle is also part of a scientific research project.

The game was the developed (and being updated from time to time) applying math, with focus in analytical geometry.

The project Analytical geometry through games had the objective of study and apply analytical geometry (and math, in general) on game development.

It's a different way to learn concepts in this field of study. You can check this [wiki page](https://github.com/luanorlandi/Swift-Space-Battle/wiki) to see for yourself and learn analytical geometry in a more interesting manner.

There is also a portuguese pdf made at the end of the scientific research project, check it out [here](https://github.com/luanorlandi/Swift-Space-Battle/blob/master/wiki/A%20geometria%20anal%C3%ADtica%20no%20jogo%20Swift%20Space%20Battle.pdf).
